  <h1>👋 Hello World!</h1>
<hr>
<p>I like traveling it's a <strong>wonderful way to explore the world, discover new cultures and create unforgettable memories.</strong><br>
  It allows us to step out of our comfort zone and connect with other people cultures, languages and different foods and flavors.<br>
Traveling makes us more open minded and gets us to try new things like walking, hiking, skating...etc. things that we re not used to do. <br>
Discover new cities, meet different people. See how others live and think.
Travel is beneficial for personal growth mental health and overall well being and building relationships and connections from different parts of the world.
